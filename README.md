## Getting Started

UIDAM Portal is a React-based web application built with modern technologies including React 18, TypeScript, Material-UI, and Vite. It provides an intuitive interface for administrators to manage the complete UIDAM ecosystem.

### Prerequisites

1. Node.js version 19.5.0 or higher
2. npm version 9.0.0 or higher
3. Access to running instances of:
   - [UIDAM User Management](https://github.com/eclipse-ecsp/uidam-user-management) service
   - [UIDAM Authorization Server](https://github.com/eclipse-ecsp/uidam-authorization-server) service

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/eclipse-ecsp/uidam-portal.git
cd uidam-portal
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure the application:

**Required OAuth Configuration:**

Before configuring the portal, you must register it as an OAuth2 client in the UIDAM System. During registration, you will receive:
- `REACT_APP_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` - The client ID for your portal application
- `REACT_APP_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` - The client secret for your portal application

**Important:** When registering the OAuth2 client in UIDAM, you must configure the redirect URI (callback URL). This should match the value you set for `REACT_APP_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI` in your portal configuration.

Edit the `public/config.json` file with your configuration:
```json
{
  "REACT_APP_UIDAM_AUTH_SERVER_URL": "https://your-auth-server:9443",
  "REACT_APP_UIDAM_USER_MANAGEMENT_URL": "https://your-user-mgmt:8080",
  "REACT_APP_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID": "your-client-id-from-registration",
  "REACT_APP_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET": "your-client-secret-from-registration",
  "REACT_APP_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI": "http://localhost:5173/auth/callback"
}
```

**Required Configuration Parameters:**
- `REACT_APP_UIDAM_AUTH_SERVER_URL`: URL of the UIDAM Authorization Server
- `REACT_APP_UIDAM_USER_MANAGEMENT_URL`: URL of the UIDAM User Management service
- `REACT_APP_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`: Client ID obtained after registering the portal in the UIDAM system
- `REACT_APP_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`: Client secret obtained after registering the portal in the UIDAM system
- `REACT_APP_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI`: Callback URL endpoint for OAuth authentication. Must match the redirect URI configured during client registration in UIDAM

**Note:** For development, the redirect URI is typically `http://localhost:5173/auth/callback`. For production deployments, update this to match your production URL (e.g., `https://your-portal-domain.com/auth/callback`).

### Running Locally

#### Development Mode
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

#### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

#### Preview Production Build
```bash
npm run preview
```

### Running with Docker

#### Building and Running

1. Build the Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t uidam-portal:latest .
```

2. Run the container:
```bash
docker run -p 8080:80 uidam-portal:latest
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8080`

**Important for Docker Deployment:**
- Update the `public/config.json` file before building the Docker image with your production configuration
- Ensure `REACT_APP_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI` matches your deployment URL (e.g., `http://your-domain:8080/auth/callback`)
- The redirect URI configured here must match the one registered in the UIDAM System for your OAuth2 client

### Running the Tests

#### Unit Tests
```bash
npm test
```

#### Watch Mode
```bash
npm run test:watch
```

#### Coverage Report
```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

### Code Quality

#### Linting
```bash
npm run lint
```

#### Auto-fix Linting Issues
```bash
npm run lint:fix
```

#### Format Code
```bash
npm run format
```

#### Type Checking
```bash
npm run type-check
```

## Usage

UIDAM Portal provides comprehensive management capabilities for:

### User Management
- Create, edit, and delete users
- Assign users to accounts
- Manage user roles and permissions
- View user details and activity

### Account Management
- Create and manage accounts
- Assign roles to accounts
- Configure account-level permissions
- Monitor account status

### Role Management

## Architecture

The portal follows a modern React architecture:

### Technology Stack
- **React 18**: UI framework
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development
- **Material-UI (MUI)**: Component library
- **React Router**: Client-side routing
- **Redux Toolkit**: State management
- **TanStack Query**: Server state management
- **React Hook Form + Yup**: Form handling and validation
- **Axios**: HTTP client
- **Vite**: Build tool
- **Jest**: Testing framework

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Application won't start
- Ensure Node.js version 18+ is installed
- Delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`, then run `npm install` again
- Check that all required environment variables are set

#### Cannot connect to backend services
- Verify that UIDAM User Management and Authorization Server are running
- Check the API URLs in your `public/config.json` file
- Ensure CORS is properly configured on backend services

#### OAuth/Authentication Issues
- Verify that `REACT_APP_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` and `REACT_APP_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` are correctly set from your UIDAM client registration
- Ensure `REACT_APP_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI` in `public/config.json` matches exactly with the redirect URI configured during OAuth2 client registration in UIDAM
- Check that the redirect URI matches your deployment environment (localhost for dev, production domain for production)

#### Build fails
- Run `npm run type-check` to identify TypeScript errors
- Run `npm run lint` to identify code quality issues
- Ensure all dependencies are properly installed
